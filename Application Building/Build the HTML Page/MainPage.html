In phishing detection, an incoming URL is identified as phishing or not by analysing the different features of the URL and is classified accordingly. Different machine learning algorithms are trained on various datasets of URL features to classify a given URL as phishing or legitimate.</p>

          <h3> Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>

<p>There are several machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest-Neighbor for detecting phishing websites.

<div class ="course-col">
    <h3> Approaches</h3>

<p>In List Based approach, there are two lists, called whitelist and blacklist to classify legitimate and phishing URLs respectively. In [5], access to websites takes place only if the URL is in the whitelist. In [6] blacklist is used. In Heuristic Based approach, the structure of a phishing URL is analysed. A pattern of URLs that were previously classified as phishing is created. URLs are classified according to their compliance with this pattern. The methods used to process the features of the URL plays a significant role in classifying websites accurately . </p>
